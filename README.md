# :video_camera: WebCam software sampling
This is a WebCam software used in the <kbd>Photon-pixel coupling</kbd> method. The application is made in <kbd>Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6)</kbd>. The WebCam software for the Photon-pixel coupling method takes images at equal intervals (user defined) and saves them as BMP files in a dedicated folder. These saved files are later used in the analysis by a software called [Vesta](https://github.com/Gagniuc/Prototype-software-for-Photon-pixel-coupling). For more information, please read:
